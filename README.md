# The-Alchemist
A class mod for Baldur's Gate 3, created within Glasses.exe, otherwise known as the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit.

The file has been extracted from Baldur's Gate 3's native .PAK format and compressed into a .RAR file for easier browsing. The best way to view the output of my work is, of course, to play the mod!

Installation:
To install, you'll need to recompress this mod into a .PAK file, and drop it into 'AppData/Local/Larian Studios/Baldur's Gate 3/Mods/', or simply install it via the in-game Mod Manager ('The Alchemist' by the Lightkeeper). This repository is primarily to demonstrate the mod as an element of my portfolio.

Disclaimer on AI: Artificial Intelligence was used to generate custom icons for abilities, and the class emblems. Generally, I am against the use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in a project so dear to me, and in sectors where human expression is so important. It was used as a tool to enhance the mod, not create it, and I feel it is important to let others know the aspects of the mod that do not reflect my personal ability. If more resources were available to me, I would have preferred to commission art from talented artists. All abilities, scripting, programming, and creative decision making is a reflection of my own ability.
